Add multiple images for a single product and show it as a gallery view.

== Description ==

Marketpress is a very popular e-commerce plugin introduced by WPMU DEV. This plugin allows you to add multiple images for every single product, and you can show the images as a gallery view. You have three options to show the gallery - automatic, shortcode and template function. Very simple and lightweight.

It will create a gallery like viewport. You will be able to navigate with arrows to see more images, if you click on thumb you will see the large images. And if you hover over the large image, you will see zommed image. The best output will be if you upload image larger than 300 X 440 (keep the same proportion).

Note that, the plugin is not responsive yet.
